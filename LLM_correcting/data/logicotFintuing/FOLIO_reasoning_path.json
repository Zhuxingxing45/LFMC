Thus, in this case, Amy is not an Olympic gold medal winner, and we can conclude that Amy is a Nobel physics laureate (since all Nobel physics laureates are full-time scientists, and no full-time scientists spend the majority of their time on sports, so they must spend most of their time on other activities). \n\nCase 2: Amy is an Olympic gold medal winner.\nIn this case, Amy is a professional athlete and spends most of her time on sports. Since she spends most of her time on sports, she cannot be a full-time scientist (premise 3). Therefore, Amy cannot be a Nobel physics laureate.\n\nNow we can see that in both cases, if Amy is not an Olympic gold medal winner, then Amy is a Nobel physics laureate.

We are given the premises:\n   - All velvet-finish lipsticks in the Rouge Dior set, Lunar New Year Limited Edition are refillable.\n   - Lipsticks in the Rouge Dior set, Lunar New Year Limited Edition have either a velvet-finish or a satin-finish.\n   - No satin-finish lipsticks in the set do not have \"rosewood\" in its offical description.\n   - Lipsticks in the Rouge Dior set, Lunar New Year Limited Edition either does not have \"rosewood\" in its offical description or it has \"rosewood\" in its official description.\n   - ROUGE Dior Colored Lip Balm 999 is a lipstick in the set, and it either has \"rosewood\" in its official description or has a velvet finish.\n\n2. We are asked to determine if the following hypothesis is true:\n   - If ROUGE Dior Colored Lip Balm 999 either does not have \"rosewood\" in its official description or is refillable, then it has \"rosewood\" in its official description.\n\n3. Let's analyze the given premises:\n   - If ROUGE Dior Colored Lip Balm 999 has a velvet finish, then it is refillable according to the first premise.\n   - If it has \"rosewood\" in its official description, then it matches the second part of the last premise.\n\n4. Now let's consider the possible scenarios for ROUGE Dior Colored Lip Balm 999:\n   - Scenario 1: ROUGE Dior Colored Lip Balm 999 has \"rosewood\" in its official description.\n     - In this case, it matches the second part of the last premise, so it either does not have \"rosewood\" in its official description or is refillable.\n     - It also has \"rosewood\" in its official description, which means the hypothesis is true in this scenario.\n\n   - Scenario 2: ROUGE Dior Colored Lip Balm 999 does not have \"rosewood\" in its official description.\n     - In this case, it does not match the second part of the last premise, so it does not have \"rosewood\" in its official description.\n     - Since it does not have \"rosewood\" in its official description, it is not refillable according to the first premise.\n     - In this scenario, the hypothesis is also true.\n\n5. Since both scenarios lead to the hypothesis being true, we can conclude that the hypothesis is true. The correct answer is A) True."

Since Oxford Circus is a road junction connecting Oxford Street and Regent Street, it must be located in London as well. Furthermore, John Nash designed a construction on Regent Street and Oxford Circus, and John Nash is a British architect, which implies that he is familiar with locations in London. Additionally, Oxford Circus is the entrance to Oxford Circus tube station, a part of the Central line in 1900, which is also located in London.\n\nTherefore, the hypothesis that Regent Street is not in London is incorrect, making the correct answer B)False."

Thus, the correct answer is:\n\nC) Uncertain"

If a game has sold more than 100 million copies, then it is one of the top-3 best-selling video games.\n3. Some games that support Windows are developed by Nintendo.\n4. All multiplatform games can be played on a wide range of devices.\n5. Pokemon Diamond version is neither developed by Nintendo nor can be played on a wide range of devices.\n\nNow let's analyze the hypothesis:\nIf Pokemon Diamond version either supports Windows or has sold more than 100 million copies, then Pokemon Diamond version either is both multiplatform and one of the top-3 best selling video games, or is neither multiplatform nor one of the top-3 best selling video games.\n\nCase 1: Pokemon Diamond version supports Windows\n- From point 3, we know that some games that support Windows are developed by Nintendo, but Pokemon Diamond version is not developed by Nintendo. So, it must be developed by another company.\n- Since it is developed by a different company, it cannot be multiplatform (as all multiplatform games are developed by Nintendo). So, it is not multiplatform.\n- Since it doesn't support Windows, it cannot be one of the top-3 best-selling video games (as all top-3 best-selling video games support Windows).\n- Therefore, in this case, Pokemon Diamond version is neither multiplatform nor one of the top-3 best-selling video games.\n\nCase 2: Pokemon Diamond version has sold more than 100 million copies\n- From point 2, if a game has sold more than 100 million copies, it is one of the top-3 best-selling video games.\n- From point 1, if a game is one of the top-3 best-selling video-games, then it is multiplatform.\n- Since it has sold more than 100 million copies, it is one of the top-3 best-selling video games and is multiplatform.\n- Therefore, in this case, Pokemon Diamond version is both multiplatform and one of the top-3 best-selling video games.\n\nBased on the analysis of both cases, the hypothesis is true."

However, the hypothesis states that Garry is sentenced to a punishment. \n\nWe cannot definitively conclude whether Garry is guilty or not because there are two possibilities for his guilt status: \n\n1. Garry is guilty, but since he was not found guilty, this means he is not truly guilty according to the first premise. In this case, he should not be sentenced to a punishment, which contradicts the hypothesis.\n2. Garry is not guilty, but since he is sentenced to a punishment, this means he is truly guilty according to the third premise, which also contradicts the hypothesis.\n\nTherefore, we cannot determine whether Garry is guilty or not, making the correct answer 'Uncertain'."

Since Garry is a convicted criminal, we can apply the premise \"All convicted criminals who did not commit a crime are truly innocent.\" This means that if Garry did not commit a crime, he would be truly innocent.\n3.
