B) At the end of the 1800s, prices in general in Australia rose more rapidly than did the wholesale price of wool sold domestically.\n\nReasoning process:\n\nThe apparent paradox is that the family generated more income from selling their wool, but they failed to enjoy a commensurate increase in prosperity. To resolve this paradox, we need to find a reason why their income increase did not lead to a corresponding increase in their prosperity.\n\nOption A states that the prices of wool sold to domestic markets decreased dramatically, but this would actually increase the family's prosperity as they would be selling more wool at higher international prices.\n\nOption C states that competition in wool sales increased, leaving Australian wool producers in a less favorable position. However, this would also mean that the family's income increase from wool sales would be less significant, not helping to resolve the paradox.\n\nOption D states that international and domestic prices for other products fell sharply, but this does not directly affect the wool sales or the family's prosperity.\n\nOption B states that prices in general in Australia rose more rapidly than the wholesale price of wool sold domestically. This means that the family's increased income from wool sales might not have been enough to keep up with the rising cost of living in Australia, thus explaining why they failed to enjoy a commensurate increase in prosperity. This option helps to resolve the apparent paradox.",

The original reasoning process states that option D does not directly affect the wool sales or the family's prosperity. However, this is not accurate. If the international and domestic prices for mutton, sheepskins, and other products produced by the Australian sheep farmers fell sharply during the period in question, it could have a significant impact on the family's overall income and prosperity. \n\nThe family's income is not solely dependent on wool sales. They also earn income from other products like mutton and sheepskins. If the prices for these products fell sharply, it could offset the increased income they earned from wool sales, thus explaining why they did not enjoy a commensurate increase in prosperity despite the increase in income from wool sales. \n\nTherefore, the correct option is D) The international and domestic prices for mutton, sheepskins, and certain other products produced by all Australian sheep farmers fell sharply during the period in question."
