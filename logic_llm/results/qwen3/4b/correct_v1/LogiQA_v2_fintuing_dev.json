According to the secular stagnation theory, this is because the equilibrium real interest rate continues to decline and has fallen into the negative range. The central bank is constrained by the zero zero limit and it is difficult to lower the real interest rate to the equilibrium real interest rate. Therefore, the relatively high real interest rate leads to the continuous suppression of aggregate demand (especially investment demand). That is why, even with zero interest rates in the US, Japan and Europe, output gaps remain negative and recovery is hard to achieve. According to this theory, some argue that China's economy also faces a lack of investment demand and a prolonged period of stagnation.",
