        "premise": "New research shows that improving the reflectivity of urban roofs and road surfaces may reduce the temperature of the earth's atmosphere at a very low cost. Although the reduction is small, it can be measured. Because roofs and roads account for more than 60% of the city's surface area, the use of light-colored materials can increase the average reflectivity to a certain extent, reducing the global average temperature by as much as 0.07 degrees Celsius, according to researchers in the Environmental Research report.",

Even the most adept forgers cannot duplicate all of the characteristics the program analyzes.",

        "premise": "How did ancient sages affect scientists with subversive innovations such as Einstein? On the surface, these ancients' cognition of physics and the whole field of science was naive and full of mistakes, and they knew almost nothing about science. However, they asked many fundamental questions and had a serious discussion. If contemporary scientists want to get rid of the shackles of conventional thinking, these ancient sages will be the source of inspiration: they are subversive in pursuing the forefront of knowledge. At the same time, the childish problem will guide people into Xinjiang.",
        "hypothesis": "The purpose of the above words is to argue that science should continue to advance on the basis of sublating the thoughts of ancient sages.",
