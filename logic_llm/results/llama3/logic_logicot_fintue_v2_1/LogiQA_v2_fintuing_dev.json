So, A and B cannot be present together in any laboratories.\n- Since B and C are present together in some laboratories, this means that those laboratories can identify shapes (since B can recognize shapes) but not colors (since C cannot recognize colors). This does not contradict the premise that most laboratories do experiments to identify colors and shapes, as they can still identify shapes even if they cannot identify colors.\n- If B and C are present together in half of the laboratories, then the other half of the laboratories would have only one robot (either A or B or C).

B) not-entailment. \n\nReasoning: The argument states that the track was made by an animal with four toes, of which three point forward and one points backward, and since birds typically have four toes with this characteristic, the novice bird-watcher concludes that the track was made by a bird. However, this does not establish that only a bird could have made the track. There could be other animals with similar characteristics, so the argument is flawed because it does not provide sufficient evidence to prove that the track was definitively made by a bird."

This implies that the area of new commercial housing purchased by an average household must have decreased by 25% to maintain the same proportion in the household budget, since the price per square meter increased. Therefore, the assumption that the area of new commercial housing purchased by an average household remained unchanged is not valid, making it an entailment."

It states that because Sabina's teeth and gums are not throbbing, she cannot have serious dental problems, and therefore cannot have tooth decay or gum disease. This is incorrect because there are other possible dental problems that may not cause throbbing pain. The hypothesis provided is similar in that it assumes that because medical students who drink a lot of coffee should not have jittery nerves, they should not become neonatologists or surgeons.
