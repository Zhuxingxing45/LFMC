If the stock price is bought to earn profits from rapid price appreciation, then it is not suitable for a retirement fund.\n3. Some stocks are growth stocks.\n4. All mature stocks are suitable for a retirement fund.\n5. KO is a mature stock.\n\nNow let's analyze the given hypothesis:\n\"If KO is a growth stock or bought to earn profits from rapid price appreciation, then KO is neither a stock nor is its price volatile.\"\n\nIf KO is a growth stock, then it is bought to earn profits from rapid price appreciation (from premise 1), and according to premise 2, it is not suitable for a retirement fund. Since KO is a mature stock (premise 5), it must be suitable for a retirement fund. This contradicts the information from premise 2, so KO cannot be a growth stock.\n\nIf KO is not a growth stock, then it cannot be bought to earn profits from rapid price appreciation. Therefore, the hypothesis is false because the conditions of the hypothesis cannot be met based on the given premises."

Fluffy is a cat (premise 4) and cats are pets (premise 5).\n4. A deposit is required to rent an apartment in a managed building (premise 2).\n5. The security deposit can be either equal to the monthly rent at a managed building or more (premise 3).\n6. The monthly rent at the Olive Garden is $2000 (premise 7).\n7. $2000 is more than $1500 (premise 8).\n8. Tom will rent an apartment in a managed building if he is allowed to move in with Fluffy, and the security deposit is no more than $1500 (premise 9).\n9. If a managed building allows pets, then people are allowed to move in with a pet (premise 10).\n\nSince the Olive Garden is a managed building, it allows pets (from 1 and 2). Fluffy is a pet (from 3 and 4), so Tom is allowed to move in with Fluffy (from 9). The security deposit can be $2000 (from 5 and 6), which is more than $1500 (from 7), so Tom will rent an apartment (from 8). Therefore, Tom is allowed to move into an apartment in The Olive Garden with Fluffy. The correct answer is A) True."
