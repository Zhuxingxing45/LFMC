KO is a mature stock.\n\nNow let's evaluate the hypothesis:\nIf KO is a growth stock or bought to earn profits from rapid price appreciation, then KO is neither a stock nor is its price volatile.\n\nSince KO is a mature stock, it is suitable for a retirement fund, and according to premise 2, if a stock is bought to earn profits from rapid price appreciation, it is not suitable for a retirement fund. Therefore, KO cannot be bought to earn profits from rapid price appreciation. \n\nHowever, premise 3 states that some stocks are growth stocks, and premise 5 states that KO is a mature stock. It is possible that KO could be a growth stock, as it could be one of the stocks mentioned in premise 3.\n\nIf KO is a growth stock, then it would be bought to earn profits from rapid price appreciation, which contradicts the information we have about KO not being bought for this reason. \n\nTherefore, the hypothesis is false."

Therefore, it contradicts the security deposit at The Olive Garden, which is $2000.\n\nNow, let's consider premise 8. If a managed building allows pets, then people are allowed to move in with a pet. Since we already know that pets are allowed in The Olive Garden, this premise supports Tom moving in with Fluffy.\n\nHowever, the main issue is the security deposit. Since the security deposit is more than $1500, Tom will not be able to move in with Fluffy, as he stated that he will only rent an apartment if the security deposit is no more than $1500.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C) Uncertain.

Since all professional basketball players can do jump shots, and if someone can jump shots, they leap straight into the air, Yuri must be a professional basketball player.
