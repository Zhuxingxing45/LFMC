From the premise \"If KiKi neither jumps nor has legs, then KiKi is terricolous or has legs,\" we know that if KiKi does not jump or have legs, it must be terricolous or have legs.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the hypothesis \"KiKi is a barking dog\":\n\n- If KiKi is a dog, then it is an animal (from premise 6) and barks (from premise 2), which means Jane does not like KiKi (from premise 1). But Jane likes all animals that jump (from premise 3), and since KiKi is an animal, it must have legs (from premise 4 or 5), which means it must jump (from premise 4). This contradicts the fact that Jane does not like KiKi.\n\n- If KiKi is not a dog, it cannot be a barking dog.\n\nTherefore, the hypothesis \"KiKi is a barking dog\" is false. The correct answer is B. False."
