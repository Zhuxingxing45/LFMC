To resolve this paradox, we need to find a reason why their income increase did not lead to a corresponding increase in their prosperity.\n\nOption A states that the prices of wool sold to domestic markets decreased dramatically, but this would actually increase the family's prosperity as they would be selling more wool at higher international prices.\n\nOption C states that competition in wool sales increased, leaving Australian wool producers in a less favorable position. However, this would also mean that the family's income increase from wool sales would be less significant, not helping to resolve the paradox.\n\nOption D states that international and domestic prices for other products fell sharply, but this does not directly affect the wool sales or the family's prosperity.\n\nOption B states that prices in general in Australia rose more rapidly than the wholesale price of wool sold domestically. This means that the family's increased income from wool sales might not have been enough to keep up with the rising cost of living in Australia, thus explaining why they failed to enjoy a commensurate increase in prosperity. This option helps to resolve the apparent paradox.",

They also earn income from other products like mutton and sheepskins. If the prices for these products fell sharply, it could offset the increased income they earned from wool sales, thus explaining why they did not enjoy a commensurate increase in prosperity despite the increase in income from wool sales. \n\nTherefore, the correct option is D) The international and domestic prices for mutton, sheepskins, and certain other products produced by all Australian sheep farmers fell sharply during the period in question."

A)In recent years, employers have been requiring college degrees for workers in jobs that were previously performed successfully by Kravonians who did not have college degrees.\n\nReasoning process:\nThe argument states that the number of Kravonians entering the job market with a college degree will eventually be significantly higher than it has been over the last few years. However, if employers are now requiring college degrees for jobs that were previously not requiring them, this means that there might not be as many job openings for these college graduates as the argument assumes. Therefore, the number of Kravonians entering the job market with a college degree might not be as significantly higher as the argument claims, making option A the correct answer to weaken the argument.",
    "raw_logic_corrections": [
      "The mistake in the original reasoning process is that it incorrectly assumes that the requirement of college degrees for jobs that previously didn't require them would decrease the number of job openings for college graduates. This assumption is not necessarily true, as the increase in jobs requiring a degree could also be due to an increase in the number of such jobs, not just a shift in requirements.\n\nThe correct option is C) The average number of years Kravonian college students remain enrolled before completing a degree has been increasing over the past several years.\n\nThis weakens the argument because if students are taking longer to complete their degrees, then even though more students are enrolling in college, the number of graduates entering the job market each year may not increase significantly. This is because the rate of graduation could be slowed down by the longer time students are taking to complete their degrees.\n\nFinal Answer: C) The average number of years Kravonian college students remain enrolled before completing a degree has been increasing over the past several years."

This does not help to resolve the conflict between the study's findings and other studies that associate weight gain with health problems.\n\nThe correct option is B. Smokers, who tend to be leaner than nonsmokers, tend to have shorter life spans than nonsmokers. This helps to resolve the conflict because it suggests that weight gain after the age of 35 might be associated with longer life spans because it is indicative of not smoking. Other studies might have found an association between weight gain and health problems because they did not control for smoking status. \n\nFinal Answer: B) Smokers, who tend to be leaner than nonsmokers, tend to have shorter life spans than nonsmokers."

This is because snow and ice reflect more sunlight back into space than ocean water or land without snow cover. If other factors besides the reflectivity of ice and snow also affect the cooling of Earth's atmosphere, then it strengthens the argument by showing that there are additional reasons for the cooling effect, making the relationship between snow and ice coverage and the global temperature more significant.",

Therefore, even if there are other significant drains on the electrical system, reducing air conditioner use should theoretically help to prevent blackouts.\n\nThe correct option is A) Most air-conditioning in the region is used to cool businesses and factories. This resolves the discrepancy because it suggests that even if residents cut back on air conditioner use in their homes, it may not significantly impact the overall demand on the power grid if the majority of air conditioning is used in businesses and factories. This would explain why blackouts would still likely occur unless the heat wave abates.\n\nCorrected final answer: A) Most air-conditioning in the region is used to cool businesses and factories."

The argument relies on the following assumptions:\n\nA) The crater indicates an impact of more than sufficient size to have caused the mass extinction: This assumption is used to establish that the impact could have caused the mass extinction, but it does not directly support the conclusion that the impact was not the cause.\n\nB) No other event caused the rocks to melt after the impact formed the crater: This assumption is crucial in establishing that the rocks recrystallized due to the Earth's magnetic field at the time of the mass extinction, which in turn supports the conclusion that the impact was not the cause of the mass extinction.\n\nD) The recovered rocks recrystallized shortly after they melted: This assumption is also important in establishing the connection between the Earth's magnetic field at the time of the mass extinction and the recrystallized rocks, which supports the conclusion that the impact was not the cause of the mass extinction.\n\nC) The recovered rocks melted as a result of the impact that formed the crater: This assumption is not necessary for the argument to hold, as the argument focuses on the recrystallized rocks and their magnetic polarity, not on the cause of the melting of the rocks.

If the rocks did not melt as a result of the impact, then their recrystallization would not necessarily reflect the Earth's magnetic field at the time of the impact.\n\nThe correct answer is option A: The crater indicates an impact of more than sufficient size to have caused the mass extinction. This is not an assumption that the argument depends on. The argument is based on the polarity of the recrystallized rocks, not on the size of the impact.

To strengthen this argument, we need to show that this preference is not unique to the babies in the experiment and is also observed in other age groups. Option B provides this support by stating that similar experiments with older children and adults found the same tendency to pay more attention to octaves, fifths, and fourths.

      "The mistake in the original reasoning process is that it misinterprets the impact of option C. The fact that most of the new residents do not need to travel into Lamberton regularly for shopping or recreation actually supports the rail executive's argument rather than casting doubt on it. If the new residents do not need to travel regularly, they are less likely to use the train service, which could lead to low ridership and hence, serious deficits.\n\nThe correct option is A: Recently there have been sharp increases in parking fees in Lamberton and in highway tolls on major commuter routes. This statement casts the most serious doubt on the rail executive's argument because it provides a strong incentive for potential riders to use the train service instead of their own automobiles. If parking fees and highway tolls have increased sharply, people might prefer to use the train service to save money, even if they own automobiles. This could lead to increased ridership and revenue, reducing the likelihood of serious deficits.\n\nCorrected final answer: A) Recently there have been sharp increases in parking fees in Lamberton and in highway tolls on major commuter routes."

The argument does provide a comparison between the phosphorus concentration in the swamp and bottled water, which implies that the source of the data is the phosphorus concentration in both the swamp and bottled water.\n\nB) The argument does not base its conclusion on two contradictory claims. The argument states that the increase in phosphorus is not harming the swamp's native aquatic wildlife and provides evidence of the phosphorus concentration being less than that found in certain bottled water.\n\nC) The argument does not rely on evidence the relevance of which has not been established. The comparison to bottled water is used as a point of reference to argue that the phosphorus concentration in the swamp is not harmful to the aquatic wildlife.\n\nD) The argument does not concede the very point that it argues against. The argument does not concede that the increase in phosphorus is harming the swamp's native aquatic wildlife, but rather argues against this claim by providing evidence of the phosphorus concentration being less than that found in certain bottled water.\n\nThe correct answer is B) bases its conclusion on two contradictory claims. The argument claims that irrigation runoff from neighboring farms may have increased the concentration of phosphorus in the local swamp, but then states that the claim that the increase in phosphorus is harming the swamp's native aquatic wildlife is false. These two statements are contradictory, as they both address the effect of phosphorus on the swamp's aquatic wildlife but come to opposite conclusions.",

      "The mistake in the original reasoning process is that it incorrectly identifies the argument as having two contradictory claims. The argument does not contradict itself; it simply states that while the phosphorus levels may have increased due to irrigation runoff, this increase is not harmful to the swamp's aquatic wildlife. The argument then supports this claim by comparing the phosphorus levels in the swamp to those found in certain bottled water that people consume daily.\n\nThe correct answer is C) relies on evidence the relevance of which has not been established. The argument uses the comparison of phosphorus levels in the swamp to those in certain bottled water as evidence to support its claim. However, it does not establish the relevance of this comparison. Just because certain bottled water contains higher levels of phosphorus and is safe for human consumption, it does not necessarily mean that similar or lower levels of phosphorus are safe for the swamp's aquatic wildlife. The needs and tolerances of aquatic wildlife could be very different from those of humans.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is C) relies on evidence the relevance of which has not been established."

Option B provides such a reason: skilled operators can still achieve high typing speeds on the standard keyboard, but the difficulty in acquiring those skills means that the design remains beneficial for slowing down less experienced typists.

The most reasonable question that ought to be studied is whether innate mechanisms play a more important role in language acquisition than a child's immediate environment. This is because the passage is highlighting the importance of both environmental and innate factors in language acquisition and suggesting that the relationship between the two should be further investigated.

This could weaken the argument that genetically modified plants should not be included in animal feed, as the negative effects observed could be due to the introduction of a new food to the rats' diet, not necessarily the genetic modification.\n\nCorrected final answer: B) Potatoes are not normally a part of the diet of laboratory rats."

The ecological benefits and reduced dependence on foreign oil are presented as additional advantages of the gas tax, not as direct solutions to the federal budget deficit. They are relevant to the overall argument that the gas tax is beneficial, not irrelevant.\n\nThe correct option is A) The author makes incompatible assumptions. The author assumes that the relationship between the gas tax and the revenue it generates is linear (i.e., if a one-cent tax raises one billion dollars, then a fifty-cent tax will raise fifty billion dollars). However, this assumption is incompatible with the author's later point that the tax would decrease demand for gasoline. If demand decreases, consumption rates would also decrease, and the revenue generated by the tax would be less than expected. \n\nFinal Answer: A) The author makes incompatible assumptions."

It simply states that the newly discovered fossils show that birds did not descend from dinosaurs, which is a different claim.\n\nThe correct answer is A) draws a generalization that is broader than is warranted by the findings cited. The argument takes the discovery of older bird fossils and uses it to make a broad generalization that no bird descended from any dinosaur. This is a flawed reasoning because the discovery of older bird fossils does not necessarily disprove the theory that birds descended from dinosaurs.

The argument assumes that the presence of fullerenes in shungite can be used as evidence for the conditions of the Earth's crust at the time of their formation.\n\nOption D, which states that shungite itself is formed only under distinctive conditions, undermines the argument by suggesting that the presence of fullerenes in shungite may not necessarily provide information about the Earth's crust conditions at the time of their formation.

When a society undergoes rapid change, young people do not value the advice of their elders because they do not find the experience relevant.

It also states that the mints could refine gold and produced other kinds of coins that had much purer gold content. However, it does not mention any gold coins with a gold content of less than 92 percent being minted. Therefore, option A is the most strongly supported inference.",
    "raw_logic_corrections": [
      "The mistake in the original reasoning process is that it assumes that because the passage does not mention any gold coins with a gold content of less than 92 percent, no such coins were minted. This is a logical fallacy known as argument from ignorance or argumentum ad ignorantiam. Just because the passage does not mention something, it does not mean that it does not exist or did not happen.\n\nThe passage states that the mints could refine gold and produced other kinds of coins that had much purer gold content, but the Senegalese gold was never refined. This implies that there were other sources of gold that were refined to produce coins. The passage does not specify the gold content of these other sources before refining, so it is possible that some of them had a gold content of less than 92 percent.\n\nTherefore, the correct inference is D) The source of some refined gold from which coins were minted was unrefined gold with a gold content of less than 92 percent. This is because the passage mentions that other kinds of coins were produced from refined gold, and it is possible that the original gold content of these other sources was less than 92 percent.\n\nCorrected final answer: D) The source of some refined gold from which coins were minted was unrefined gold with a gold content of less than 92 percent."

Option B undermines this argument by suggesting that the increasing population of snow geese is not solely responsible for displacing other Arctic bird species. Instead, they are recolonizing previously unused wintering grounds, indicating that the issue might not be solely related to competition with other Arctic bird species. Therefore, dropping the hunting season restriction may not necessarily lead to an increase in the population of the other Arctic bird species.",

While it is true that option B suggests that the snow geese are recolonizing previously unused wintering grounds, this does not necessarily undermine the argument. The argument is based on the premise that the increasing population of snow geese is displacing other Arctic bird species in the Arctic, not in their wintering grounds. Therefore, the fact that snow geese are recolonizing wintering grounds does not directly challenge the argument's premise or conclusion.\n\nThe correct answer is option A: \"It has been many years since the restriction led to the hunting season for snow geese being closed earlier than the scheduled date.\" This statement undermines the argument by suggesting that the current hunting restrictions are not significantly reducing the snow geese population. If the hunting season has not been closed early due to reaching the five percent reduction target for many years, it implies that the hunting is not effectively controlling the snow geese population. Therefore, dropping the restriction might not have the desired effect of allowing other species to recover.\n\nCorrected final answer: A) It has been many years since the restriction led to the hunting season for snow geese being closed earlier than the scheduled date."

It also mentions that ceramic models of these vehicles have been found, suggesting that ceramic is less susceptible to disintegration than wood. Therefore, it can be inferred that more of the early wheeled vehicles not preserved were made of wood than of materials no more susceptible to disintegration than ceramic. \n\nCorrected final answer: C) Of the early wheeled vehicles not preserved, more were made of wood than were made of materials no more susceptible to disintegration than are ceramic items."

While receiving help from outstanding students could potentially improve the student's performance, it could also potentially hinder her if she becomes overly reliant on their help and does not develop her own understanding.\n\nB) This statement strengthens the argument because if the current course is a continuation of one of the courses in which the student received a B, it suggests that she has a solid foundation for the current course, which could potentially improve her chances of receiving a B.\n\nC) This statement strengthens the argument because studying in the library suggests that the student is dedicated to her studies and is putting in extra effort to achieve good grades.\n\nD) This statement strengthens the argument because if the student received a B in all but one of the twelve courses, it shows a consistent pattern of performance, and it is likely that she will continue this pattern in the new course.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A, as it does not necessarily strengthen the argument.\n\nCorrected final answer: A."

If a large competitor went out of business, it's likely that the remaining companies would see an increase in sales as a result, regardless of whether or not produce prices increased. This suggests that the increase in personal gardens may not be due to higher produce prices, but rather due to the lack of competition in the retail seed market.\n\nCorrected final answer: A) A large retail seed company went out of business early last year."

The commentator is not criticizing Roehmer's column merely based on her personal characteristics.

      "The mistake in the original reasoning process is that it incorrectly identifies option C as the correct answer. While option C does provide a potential drawback to using triple-trailer trucks, it does not directly weaken the argument that using more triple-trailer trucks would reduce highway deaths. The payload capacity of the trucks is not directly related to their safety or accident rates.\n\nOption A, on the other hand, directly weakens the argument by suggesting that the lower accident rate of triple-trailer trucks may be due to the skill of the drivers, not the trucks themselves. If only the best, most experienced drivers are driving these trucks, it's possible that the lower accident rate is due to their skill and experience, not the type of truck they're driving. This would mean that simply increasing the use of triple-trailer trucks may not necessarily lead to a decrease in highway fatalities.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A: So far only the best, most experienced drivers for Partorian trucking companies have been driving triple-trailer trucks."

However, in each group, approximately 90 percent of those who had reported relief claimed that their insomnia had returned during the third week of the study.\n3.

This suggests that the initial relief from insomnia was not due to the drug or the placebo, but potentially due to another factor.\n\nOption A provides a plausible explanation for this pattern: \"Most insomniacs sleep better in a new environment, and the new drug has no effect on an insomniac's ability to sleep.\" This suggests that the initial relief from insomnia was due to the change in environment (sleeping at the institute), not the drug or the placebo. The return of insomnia in the third week could be due to the participants becoming accustomed to the new environment, reducing its initial beneficial effect on their sleep.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is A."
