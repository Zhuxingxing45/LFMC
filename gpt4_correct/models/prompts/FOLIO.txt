给定一组前提，一个结论以及一个对于此结论的有效性进行逻辑推理的过程，任务是识别逻辑推理过程是否正确，若不正确，请找出错误步骤，解释错误原因，并从错误步骤中更正原始的解的方案，要求回答尽可能简洁。
Given a set of premises, a conclusion, and a reasoning process for the validity of this conclusion, the task is to identify whether the reasoning process is correct. If it is not correct, find the erroneous steps, explain the reasons for the errors, and correct the original solution from the erroneous steps. The response should be as concise as possible.



Premises: 
[[PROBLEM]]

Conclusion:
[[QUESTION]]

Options:
A)True, B)False, C)Uncertain

Wrong Reasoning Process: 
[[ORIGINAL_REASONING]]

Task:
以上的推理结果是错误的，正确的推理结果是[[reference]],请对以上的推理过程进行纠正，进而推理得到正确答案。
The above reasoning result is incorrect. The correct reasoning result is [[reference]]. Please correct the above reasoning process and further reason to obtain the correct answer.
